  "more_about": "Hello, my name is Samuel Michael Vani√©. Currently in the second year of Information Systems Engineering at the National School of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics of Grenoble (ENSIMAG), I am passionate about solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions. I love programming in all its aspects. Throughout my journey, I have explored various areas such as web backend and frontend programming in Javascript, Python, Java, and C#, as well as Rust (see my resume for the complete list of frameworks). I also do hybrid mobile development with Flutter and React Native, and native development with Java (yes, I haven't caught up with Kotlin yet). Above all, I love systems programming (I love challenges). Linux is my preferred OS, but I can also use Windows and MacOS.",
